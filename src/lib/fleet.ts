/**
 * Northern Lantern House fleet link registry — Fleet Shell Standard v1 §5.
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH. This file is byte-identical across every app in the
 * fleet; only `THIS_APP` below differs per app. Do not enumerate cross-app
 * links anywhere else in the application.
 *
 * Every URL here was resolved live on 2026-08-28. When you add or move an
 * instrument, update this file in every repo in the same pass — a drifted
 * footer is how the fleet stops looking like one company.
 *
 * This file and `hth-packet.ts` are both copied by hand, so both must be
 * PRETTIER-CLEAN before anyone copies them. A repo that reformats its copy has
 * produced a second version of a file that is supposed to be one file, and the
 * next diff between two repos is then unreadable. `PUBLICATIONS` sat on eight
 * lines here and on one line in three sibling repos for exactly that reason.
 *
 * Known traps, verified 2026-08-28:
 *   - Support is /customer-support, NOT /support (that path 404s).
 *   - Elsewhere, Apparently is a PUBLICATION on the house domain. Its
 *     instruments are The Money, Apparently and The Trip Clock. Linking the
 *     publication name at money.northernlanternhouse.com (or at the retired
 *     the-money-apparently.vercel.app, which 302s) is wrong on both counts.
